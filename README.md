# UI Dashboard Practice 📊

This project is a high-fidelity **Sales & Analytics Dashboard** built to practice the seven fundamentals of User Interface (UI) design. It focuses on translating complex Figma mockups into functional, responsive code while maintaining strict design standards.

## 🚀 Design Fundamentals Applied

* **White Space**: Strategic use of negative space to reduce cognitive load and improve readability.
* **Visual Hierarchy**: Utilizing **Scale** and **Weight** to guide the user's eye toward critical data points (KPIs).
* **Contrast & Color**: Implementing accessible color palettes that clearly distinguish between different data sets and action buttons.
* **Alignment**: Precise use of **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** to ensure a clean, professional "bento-box" layout.
* **Typography**: Selecting and scaling fonts to improve information density without sacrificing clarity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Semantic HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Grid & Flexbox)
* **Design Implementation**: Pixel-perfect conversion from Figma mockups.
* **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first media queries to ensure the dashboard remains functional on all device sizes.
